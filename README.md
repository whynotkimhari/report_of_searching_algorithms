# report_of_searching_algorithms
report of searching algorithms include QuickSort, MergeSort, HeapSort, and IntroSort.

## data folder
data folder includes ten (10) sets of data. Each set contains 1 milion (1000000) random real numbers (double type). </br>
one set is sorted in ASC order, one set is sorted in DSC order, and 8 sets left are in random order. <br/>
data folder also contains a program to generate all ten sets above.

## speed_rate folder
speed_rate folder includes {algorithm}.txt. <br/>
{algorithm}.txt contains ten (10) given back values of using {algorithm} to sort ten (10) dataset.

## algorithms
HeapSort.cpp, IntroSort.cpp, MergeSort.cpp, and QuickSort.cpp

## visualization given back values
chart.py: using given back values to draw a line graph which is Figure_1.png. <br/>
