***CAUTIONS1: ALL VALUES IN THIS ARE UNCERTAIN TO LEAD TO ANY FACT TO DETERMINE WHICH ALGORITHM IS "THE BEST" FOR ALL CASES. <br/>
***CAUTIONS2: ALL VALUES ARE RESULTS WHEN RUNNING THIS COMPARISON IDEA ON MY OLD AND POOR LAPTOP. <br/>
***CAUTIONS3: ALL VALUES WILL BE DIFFRENT AT EACH RUNNING TIME. IN THIS SITUATION, I RUN THIS REPORT WHEN MY LAPTOP ARE RUNNING A LOT OF PROGRAMME AT THE SAME TIME. SOME DAYS LATER, I RUN AGAIN AND IT GENERATE SOME KINDS OF "NEW" VALUES BUT NOT REALLY "DIFFERENT".
report of searching algorithms include QuickSort, MergeSort, HeapSort, and IntroSort.

## data folder
data folder includes ten (10) sets of data. Each set contains 1 milion (1000000) random real numbers (double type). </br>
one set is sorted in ASC order, one set is sorted in DSC order, and 8 sets left are in random order. <br/>
data folder also contains a program to generate all ten sets above.

## speed_rate folder
speed_rate folder includes {algorithm}.txt. <br/>
{algorithm}.txt contains ten (10) given back values of using {algorithm} to sort ten (10) dataset.

## algorithms
HeapSort.cpp, IntroSort.cpp, MergeSort.cpp, and QuickSort.cpp (random pivot)

## visualization given back values
chart.py: using given back values to draw a line graph which is Figure_1.png. <br/>
